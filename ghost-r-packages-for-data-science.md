Let's use data science to attempt to find and rank the top R packages for doing data science.


## Results based on external analyses

stack overflow

  * ?? how many packages are actually tagged
  
github

  * ?? how many packages have web pages? how to find them?



## Interactive graphic

TODO: collect data from other lists and make an interactive graphic where a user can
compare multiple lists from one graphic/dashboard

combine the data from these lists and make into interactive graphic:

## ?? Paul's subjective list of R4DS

Here is one list from a practitioner. These are R packages that are useful AND fun, and which I can recommend. But this makes the list non-exhaustive for all tasks

Data wrangling

  * dplyr
  * tidyr
  * magrittr

Graphics

  * ggplot2
  
Interactive Graphics

  * shiny
  
Modeling

  * modelr [new, not yet feature-rick]
