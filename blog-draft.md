# Identifying top R packages for machine learning

[hook]

BLUFF: provide some results up-front


# Identifying an exhaustive list of packages

Before ranking the packages to find the "top" ones, you need an exhaustive list
of R packages that are used for ML. 

This list can be scraped from a CRAN "Task View" for "Machine Learning and
Statistical Learning" (latest update: January 6, 2017 - kudos to its
maintainer, Torsten Hothorn, who keeps it current).


# How to define "best" or "top"?

Rankings should be based on some objective metrics that will yield "relevant"
results for the intended audience. 

One approach could be to rank the packages based on popularity.

Or have an expert just create a ranking or list.

# Using APIs to get usage statistics 


  * Stack Overflow
  * Github
  * (Meta) CRAN ?

How to precisely define the metrics? Look for tags?

Problems:

  * a small number of package names are common words: `earth`, `party`. We need
    to filter our results to those that are relevant to R.
  * APIs help a lot, but there are still quirks to figure out: it's useful to
    compare API results to a manual search results

# Other lists

other lists are mostly of low quality:

  * old results
  * subjective ranking
